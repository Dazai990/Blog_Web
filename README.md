## 📖 Project Description

This is the frontend for a fully functional blog website where users can register, log in, and interact with blog content. Authentication is handled using a username and password system — users are only granted access if valid credentials are provided.

Once logged in, users can:

- 🔓 Access the main blog interface
- 📰 View all blog posts written by other users in a clean, responsive **grid layout**
- ✍️ Create and publish their own blog posts
- 📚 View all their personal posts in the **"My Blogs"** section
- 🗑️ Delete their own posts

The frontend is designed to be responsive, intuitive, and visually appealing using modern web technologies.
